Hello folks, i am Mr Edgeworth. I programme in mostly python/html, but i can put my hand to other languages(mostly c++ and lua) if needed. 
I'm self taught, so i prefer functionality and cleanliness of code rather than clarity.
Whatever the current project is, i allow people to use it as long as its for private use, or code optimisation etc. 
My activity on github is all over the place, so please be patient with me.
Programming is a hobby, so any questions about my project code are welcome :) (as long as they are not deragatory :P)
I studied Networking/Cyber Security since 09/19 - 09/24.


Cheers,
Nate/Nathan
